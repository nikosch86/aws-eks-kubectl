# aws-eks-kubectl
awscli, eksctl and kubectl in a docker image for portability

the purpose of this repository is to hold data for building a docker image that includes 
the minimum tooling necessary to control AWS using `awscli`, EKS using `eksctl` and 
work with Kubernetes using `kubectl`.  

Ultimately this was made to be used in a github action that might be released at a later point in time.
